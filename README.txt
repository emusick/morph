# morph.sh was written to facilitate transcoding a FLAC audio library to
# other formats such as OGG and MP3 while preserving the metadata. It can
# generate a M3U playlist from a folder containing FLACs and OGGs. The iPod
# function is mostly useless, but takes a text file path list of audio
# tracks to be transcoded to OGG for use with the Rockbox patch for the iPod.
#
# For usage info:
# ./morph.sh
#
# To do:
# Add a proper comment header
# Add comments
# Fix the OGG playlist creator
# Remove the ipod function as I no longer need it and it's redundant
